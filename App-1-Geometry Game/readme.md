# Geometry Game: Where Math Meets Fun üìêüê¢

Welcome to the Geometry Game, where shapes come to life and turtles roam free! This quirky little Python program lets you explore the magical world of geometry with a touch of humor and creativity. Whether you're a math whiz or just someone looking for a bit of entertainment, this game is bound to tickle your fancy!

## How to Play

1. **Launch the Game**: Fire up your Python interpreter and run the script.
2. **Enter Coordinates**: You'll be prompted to enter the coordinates for your point.
3. **Watch the Magic Unfold**: Sit back and enjoy as our trusty turtle friend illustrates your point and its relationship with a randomly generated rectangle.
4. **Discover the Result**: Find out whether your point falls within the bounds of the rectangle. It's a nail-biting moment of truth!

## Features

- **Point and Rectangle Interaction**: Witness the dynamic interplay between points and rectangles as you explore their spatial relationships.
- **Graphical Representation**: Our turtle pal will draw both the rectangle and your point on the screen, bringing math to life in vivid color.
- **Interactive Fun**: Get hands-on with geometry in a playful environment that encourages experimentation and learning.
